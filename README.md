# DesignYourClassSchedule
 This is the Niubility Team. The members of our group are Miao Wenting, Li Runfa and Luo Siwei.
We want to design a schedule program. Because people always need to plan time in their daily lives, we design such a program to help them reduce the trouble of planning time.
1. We intend to use the Django framework as the backend and the Bootstrap framework as the frontend.
2. Our VCS platform is GitHub, we will use Git to operate.
3. The functions we intend to implement are: user login, style customization, query timetables, course reminders, and adding courses/exams...
4. We will use the unittest module to write tests
